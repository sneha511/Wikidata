# Wikidata

Problem Statement:
The problem is to build classifiers that would determine the most probable manner of death
without using ‘manner of death’ or ‘cause of death’ fields as the input data. These will give infinity
variations. Therefore, the classification or prediction of manner of death using Wikidata dump is
a complex problem. The capability of machine learning models to generalize and be insensitive to
the missing data would be very beneficial in predicting manner of death for Wikidata. So, in this
assignment five network models’ performances are compared for solving this classification
problem of Wikidata.
